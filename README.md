## Project defination

This is the a exam project, I have integrated API itunes (https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=star&amp;country=au&amp;media=movie&amp;all). for the listing of Artist and other to show details for the following fields.

* Track Name
* Artwork (there are multiple size formats, you should pick one that you consider appropriate for the task) 
* Price
* Genre

## Suggestions implemented
- A date when the user previously visited, shown in the list header
- Save the last screen that the user was on. When the app restores, it should present the user with that screen. 

## This are the key concepts I have used for this demo
<li>MVVM stucture with Coordinators<br/></li>
<li>Dependency Injection<br/></li>
<li>Offline support usign CoreData<br/></li>
<li>API Middle-Ware<br/></li>
<li>Create UI componets that can be reuse<br/></li>
